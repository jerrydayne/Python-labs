## Get user's input (a and b)
a = int(input("enter a number"))
b = int(input("enter another number"))

#Display
#1 Sum of a and b
sum = a = b

#2 disference when b is subtracted from a 
difference = a - b

#3 product of a and b
product = a * b

#4 The quotient when a is divided by b
quotient = a/b

#5 The remainder when a is divided by b
remainder = a % b

#6 The result of a^b
squareroot = a**b
